This shift in fuel sources reflects a change in energy policies and a shift towards cleaner energy sources.\n\nIn terms of consumption, both countries reduced their overall electricity production in 2000 compared to 1980. Australia's total production decreased by 15%, while France's production decreased by 10%. However, France increased its consumption of nuclear power, while Australia increased its consumption of natural gas.
